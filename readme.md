# Fourth C++ User Group Frankfurt Meetup ðŸ¥³

* templates in C++ are **hard** to understand
* the best practice changes from standard to standard
* in automotive we are stuck to C++14
  * if we are lucky we have C++17
* Copilot just guesses (often wrong)
* even Stackoverflow is not always helpful
* learning the concepts behind the implementation safes us hopefully one or two Google searches

# Type Traits and std::enable_if

In this Meetup we will:
* learn about Substitution Failure is not an Error (SFINAE)
* implement a simple type trait
* activate type dependent template specializations using `std::enable_if`
* simplify the example using *_v and *_t
* reduce the boilerplate code by some clever template programming

---

## Scope
* C++14
* understand the logic behind it

## Out of Scope
* C++17 and later
* constraints and concepts from C++20

---

## Hands-On Coding - no slides

* I'm Daniel
* please ask questions right away
* this is a real world example from our daily work
